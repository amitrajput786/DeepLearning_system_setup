the compatiablitity for the tensorflow the with the cuda 
2.19.0 is with the 12.1
to download the commands 
pip install tnesorflow==2.19.0 

** the tensor rt are instlalled in my system 
 here are the advantages of it  to my system : 
Benefits You'll Get:

2-5x faster inference (depending on model)
Lower memory usage
Automatic precision optimization (FP16/INT8)
Better GPU utilization

Recommended Next Steps:

Convert your existing models to TensorRT format
Use FP16 precision for best speed/accuracy balance
Benchmark before/after performance
Consider INT8 quantization for maximum speed
